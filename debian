REALPATH(1)                          Debian                          REALPATH(1)



NAME
       realpath - return the canonicalised absolute pathname

SYNOPSIS
       realpath [-s|--strip] [-z|--zero]  filename  ...
       realpath --h|--help
       realpath --v|--version

DESCRIPTION
       realpath  converts  each filename argument to an absolute pathname, which
       has no components that are  symbolic  links  or  the  special  .   or  ..
       directory entries.  (See realpath(3) for more information.)
       Please  note  that  mostly the same functionality is provided by the `-f'
       option of the readlink(1) command.

       If option -s is used realpath only removes .  and  ..   directories,  but
       not symbolic links from filename.

       Each  converted  pathname  is  output  to the standard output, on its own
       line.

OPTIONS
       -s,--strip
            Only strip .  and .., but do not resolve symbolic links.

       -z,--zero
            Separate  output  filenames  with  the  null  character  instead  of
            newline, so it can be used with the `-0' option of xargs(1).

       -h,--help
            Print short usage information.

       -v,--version
            Show realpath's version number.

EXAMPLES
       Let's  suppose  that  /usr/bin/X11  is  a  symbolic link, which points to
       directory /usr/bin.
       Than
              realpath /../usr/bin/X11/./xterm
       prints
              /usr/bin/xterm
       but
              realpath -s /../usr/bin/X11/./xterm
       outputs
              /usr/bin/X11/xterm

EXIT STATUS
       realpath returns a zero exit code when  all  pathnames  was  successfully
       converted.
       In  case  of  any  errors (e.g. missing or unavailable directories in the
       path), realpath prints error message to stderr  and  returns  a  non-zero
       exit code.
